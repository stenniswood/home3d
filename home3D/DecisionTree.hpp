/*
	BK Algorithm for "Maze Solving"
	Add starting location as the root node.
	
	Scan 4 directions plus 4 diagonals.
	When they hit a wall or object, record the next possible end points.
		ie. Scan the doors on that wall which are accessible.  
		Add them to the tree as leaves.
		if the wall ends with out a corner wall blocking the end.  Record that end.
		Search both directions from the intersection point.
			
		If another wall prevents reaching the end, don't record that corner position.
				It's a dead end.  ie. another direction should provide a door way.
==

	The tree was implemented in MathVectorTree.  That is the node for the entire tree.
    other supporting routines (buds and leaves) are in Map2D.
